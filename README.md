# 3DEmotionBall

This is a "remake" (probably like the third) of my old 3D Emotion Ball mod, hopefully the last one.
Once it's finished I'm gonna upload it to GB.

So far the main changes from the old versions are:
- Code rewritten completely from scratch
- Hero Chaos Chao halo now works properly with the special blending,
thanks to Shaddatic's help figuring it out (separating the halo model to draw outside first and a special hack
to make it z-write)
- Specular effect, also thanks to Shad's help, he showed me a pretty clean and simple technique,
using a transparent environment map overlay to "emulate" specular
- The models are loaded externally and replaceable by other mods
- Config option for neutral chaos/dark chaos emote balls to use the model or sprites for the emotions (like exclamation etc.)
- Config option to rotate the expressions (exclamation, question, etc) with the head
- "Extras" options to give color to the Neutral/Dark Chaos chao expressions
